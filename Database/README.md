# database script storage
~~Following the instruction on https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/flask-iot-server-database.html, several python scripts are written to create and interact with a SQLite3 database. The database is used to store data received from the IoT device and other data if needed.~~

~~Currently all the scripts are stored in separate files. Encapsulation will be performed along with the back end code.~~

**update on 13 Sep**: modularized scripts and merged the functions into one file (iotDB.py)
