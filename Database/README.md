# Database creation script
Following the instruction on https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/flask-iot-server-database.html, a python script is written to create a SQLite3 database. The database is used to store data received from the IoT device and other data if needed.

Currently all the scripts are stored in separate files. Encapsulation will be performed along with the back end code.
